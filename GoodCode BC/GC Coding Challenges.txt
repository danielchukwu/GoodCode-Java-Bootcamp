The below code has a bug or two, using the Debugger tool fix all the bugs in the code.
The code should randomly print either "hit", "stay", or "fold" but right now if ran it only prints fold
NOTE: Use the Debugger To fix this

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      String option = "";

      int random = (int) Math.random() * 1 + 3;

      switch (random) {
         case 1: option = "hit";
         case 2: option = "stay";
         case 3: option = "fold";
         default: option = "This option should never get called";
      }

      if (!option.equals("hit") || !option.equals("stay")) {
         System.out.println("fold");
      } else {
         System.out.println(option);
      }
   }
}

b. Difficulty: Medium
Now we have some bugs on our below code. Using the debugger tool fix this bugs
If user is not of age they shouldn't be able to apply and if the user have any debt they still shouldn't be able to apply
But, if the user is of age to apply and has no debts, they should be able to see 
NOTE: Use the Debugger To fix this

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
      System.out.println("Enter your age: ");
      int age = scan.nextInt();        // try 18, 16;
      System.out.println("How much do you owe in debt: ");
      double debt = scan.nextDouble();   // try 0, 30;

      String creditScore = debt > 0? "Good" : "Bad";
      boolean canApply = age < 18;

      if (!canApply && creditScore.equals("Good")) {
         System.out.println("We're processing your application");
      } else {
         System.out.println("You cannot apply");
      }
   }
}
