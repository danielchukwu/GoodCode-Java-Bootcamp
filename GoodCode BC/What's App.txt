*A TOAST*🍷

*Hey congratulations, by the end of today we would have covered 20% of this beginner to professional java course.* 
Keep it up 👍. 

*Keep making out time, an hour or 2 everyday to watch this videos and practice*, if you do so, I assure you java won't 
be a problem for you and the men you trust this semester or any semester😤.

*No matter how packed and stressful the day might be, I believe you can do this. So Stand Strong - (Bishop Dave would say) and keep showing up. GOODLUCK* 🙏
